# Prelude-Self-Study

Hello! Welcome to the self-study part of the prelude. For those who have received this link, we have provided some introductory concepts which we will assume as a baseline of knowledge when we start teaching. On the Python front, this includes Variable Assignment and Strings, Data Types and Structures, Control Flow, For Loops and Functions. On the Maths front, we provide content for Vectors, Matrices and Pre-calculus.

Please work through it and ensure you understand the content. As per the contents of the email which linked you to this repo, the teaching team and I will be available should you not be able to follow any of the concepts we have presented.

Enjoy! And see you soon!
